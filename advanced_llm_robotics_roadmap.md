# Advanced LLM Concepts for Robotics Command Parsing

This document lists advanced concepts you can integrate into your robotics pipeline (user prompt → schema → MoveIt execution).

---

## 1. Function Calling / Tool Use
- LLMs like GPT-4o can call functions directly instead of generating free-form JSON.
- Example:
  ```python
  def pick_place(object: str, target: str): ...
  ```
  LLM output → `pick_place("red cube", "blue sphere")`

**Benefit:** Safer, always structured, avoids malformed JSON.

---

## 2. Few-Shot & Programmatic Prompting
- Provide the model with examples of prompt → schema outputs.
- Use structured prompting for consistent outputs.

**Benefit:** Reduces ambiguity and improves reliability.

---

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) / Reasoning Traces
- Allow model to reason step by step before schema output.
- Example reasoning:
  ```
  User: put cube on sphere
  Model: Steps → pick cube, place on sphere
  ```

**Benefit:** Handles longer/hierarchical tasks safely.

---

## 4. Hierarchical Planning with LLMs
- LLM handles semantic high-level tasks, MoveIt handles low-level motion.
- Example: “Set the table” → LLM breaks into subtasks (fetch plate, place spoon).

**Benefit:** Scales to multi-step tasks.

---

## 5. Guardrails & Structured Validation
- Use Guardrails AI or Pydantic validators.
- Example: if action is `"fly"`, guardrails block and request clarification.

**Benefit:** Prevents unsafe or invalid robot actions.

---

## 6. Self-Reflection / Error Correction
- On failure (e.g., MoveIt collision), return error to LLM to replan.
- Example prompt:
  ```
  Motion failed: collision detected. Suggest alternative.
  ```

**Benefit:** Robot adapts dynamically.

---

## 7. Multi-Modal Integration (Vision + Text)
- Combine object detection with LLM reasoning.
- Example input:
  ```
  Detected: red cube at (x,y,z), blue sphere at (x,y,z).
  Command: "Stack cube on sphere"
  ```

**Benefit:** Grounded in real perception.

---

## 8. Memory & Context Tracking
- Store dialogue/action history in memory (vector DB).
- Example:
  - User: “Pick the cube.”
  - Later: “Now put it on the sphere.”

**Benefit:** Maintains continuity between commands.

---

## 9. RLHF-Style Fine-Tuning
- Fine-tune smaller LLMs (like Mistral 7B) with robot-schema dataset.
- Makes parsing highly accurate.

**Benefit:** Tailors LLM to robotics-specific use case.

# Recommended Priorities
1. Function calling & guardrails
2. Vision grounding (multi-modal RAG)
3. Feedback/self-reflection loop
4. Memory & context tracking
5. Fine-tuning (future advanced step)
